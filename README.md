## About project

This application is based on the Spring Boot framework. 

The application is a simple translator. The translation takes place using the Google Translation API. It is possible to translate into 108 languages.

When creating the project, I tried to follow all the best practices. 

Interacted with the Google Translation API using Rest Template. Each word of the query is translated in a separate stream, the maximum number of streams is 10. 

The template engine was FreeMarker.

All user input is double-validated on the browser side and on the server side.

"@â„–&=+*{}<>%$#" these characters do not pass validation.

The project handles various errors such as 400, 404, 500 using GlobalExceptionHandler.

Data about user requests is saved to the PostgreSQL database. 

All HTML pages support a light and dark theme depending on the browser theme. 

Logging is well implemented in the project. 

Many tests have been written for each class of the project.
